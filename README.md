Haskell solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problems.

This is being used as a way to learn Haskell, so the solutions are simply a means to practice the language (that is, they might be a little messy).

Compile program (note `ghc` needs to be installed). This will create the `main` executable, and place the compiled `.o` and `.hi` files in their respective directories.

```
$ ghc --make main.hs -odir o -hidir hi
```

Run main

```
$ ./main
