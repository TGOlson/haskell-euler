Haskell solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problems.

This is being used as a way to learn Haskell, so the solutions are simply a means to practice the language (that is, they might be a little messy).

Run the program

```
$ cabal run

Problem 1 - 233168 [solved]
Problem 2 - 4613732 [solved]
...

```

Specify problem:

```
$ cabal run -p 2

Problem 2 - 4613732 [solved]
