-- Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
-- a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
-- begin by sorting it into alphabetical order.
-- Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
-- multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
--
-- For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
-- COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
-- So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
--
-- What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

-- kinda gross cheating... but w/e
-- could also use template haskell to inline the file...
